RendezVous
==========

RendezVous is a card game dreamed up by my husband many years ago. It has lived in several incarnations - first as an exercise in PyGame sometime around 2007, the code to which I have regrettably lost along the way; second as a single and multi-player game within Second Life; and now as a tool by which to learn the much-coveted skill of app design using Kivy.
